1. A Python tool to convert Gregorian dates into a 13-month calendar for consistent and simplified time-based data analysis.

A uniform calendar system with 13 equal-length months designed to replace the irregular structure of the Gregorian calendar for improved analytical consistency.

3. Tagline Style (Good for project intro or pitch):
From chaos to consistency â€” convert Gregorian dates into a clean, balanced 13-month format to simplify time-series modeling.
